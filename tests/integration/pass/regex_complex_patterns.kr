# Complex regex patterns
# Expected output:
# true
# true
# [abc, def, ghi]
# [123, 456, 789]
# true
# false
# [a, b, c]

# Multiple groups in findall
set result1 to call regex.findall with "abc def ghi", "[a-z]+"
print result1

# Numbers separated by text
set result2 to call regex.findall with "abc123def456ghi789", "[0-9]+"
print result2

# Word boundaries (simulated with spaces)
set result3 to call regex.match with "hello world", "hello world"
print result3

# Partial match (should not match entire string)
set result4 to call regex.match with "hello world", "hello"
print result4

# Character class with negation (using [^...])
set result5 to call regex.findall with "abc123", "[^0-9]"
print result5
