# Test: F-strings with width and alignment format specifiers
# Expected: Pass

set x to 42

# Default alignment (right)
print f"|{x:10}|"

# Explicit alignments
print f"|{x:<10}|"
print f"|{x:>10}|"
print f"|{x:^10}|"

# With strings
set name to "Alice"
print f"|{name:<10}|"
print f"|{name:>10}|"
print f"|{name:^10}|"

# Narrow width (no padding needed)
print f"|{x:2}|"
print f"|{name:3}|"
