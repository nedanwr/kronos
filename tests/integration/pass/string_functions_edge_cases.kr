# Test string function edge cases

# split with empty string
set parts1 to call split with "", ","
print parts1
# Expected: [""] or []

# split with delimiter not found
set parts2 to call split with "hello", "x"
print parts2
# Expected: ["hello"]

# join with empty list
set empty_list to list
set joined1 to call join with empty_list, "-"
print joined1
# Expected: ""

# join with single element
set single_list to list "hello"
set joined2 to call join with single_list, "-"
print joined2
# Expected: "hello"

# replace with empty string
set replaced1 to call replace with "hello", "", "x"
print replaced1
# Expected: "hello" (no replacement)

# replace with pattern not found
set replaced2 to call replace with "hello", "xyz", "world"
print replaced2
# Expected: "hello"

# trim with only spaces
set trimmed1 to call trim with "   "
print trimmed1
# Expected: ""

# trim with newlines
set trimmed2 to call trim with "\nhello\n"
print trimmed2
# Expected: "hello" (trim removes leading/trailing whitespace)

# contains with empty substring
set has_empty to call contains with "hello", ""
print has_empty
# Expected: true (empty string is contained in any string)

# starts_with with empty string
set starts_empty to call starts_with with "hello", ""
print starts_empty
# Expected: true

# ends_with with empty string
