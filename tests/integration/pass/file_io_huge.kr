# File I/O with large files and number conversion
# Tests reading a large file and converting its content to a number
# Expected output:
# 1. As Text (String): [content of huge.txt]
# 2. As Number (Calculated): [number value]
# 3. Let's try math (num + 1): [number + 1]

# Create the test file first
call write_file with "huge.txt", "12345678901234567890"

set text to call read_file with "huge.txt"
print "1. As Text (String):"
print text

print "2. As Number (Calculated):"
set num to call to_number with text
print num

print "3. Let's try math (num + 1):"
print num plus 1
