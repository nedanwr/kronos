# Test: Multi-line lambda with block body
# Expected: Pass

# Multi-line lambda that adds and prints
set add_and_print to function with a, b:
    set sum to a plus b
    print sum
    return sum

set result to call add_and_print with 3, 4
print result

# Another multi-line lambda with conditional
set abs_value to function with n:
    if n is less than 0:
        return n times -1
    return n

print call abs_value with -5
print call abs_value with 5
