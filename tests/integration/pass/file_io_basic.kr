# Basic file I/O operations
# Expected output:
# File content: Hello, World!
# File exists: true
# Lines: 1
# Line 1: Single line content

# Write a test file
call write_file with "test_file.txt", "Hello, World!"

# Read it back
set content to call read_file with "test_file.txt"
print f"File content: {content}"

# Check if file exists
set exists to call file_exists with "test_file.txt"
print f"File exists: {exists}"

# Write a single-line file
call write_file with "test_lines.txt", "Single line content"

# Read lines
set lines to call read_lines with "test_lines.txt"
set line_count to call len with lines
print f"Lines: {line_count}"

# Print each line (only if we have lines)
if line_count is greater than 0:
    for i in range 0 to line_count minus 1:
        let line_num to i plus 1
        set line to lines at i
        print f"Line {line_num}: {line}"
