# Test read_lines edge cases

# File with only newlines
call write_file with "newlines_only.txt", "\n\n\n"
set lines1 to call read_lines with "newlines_only.txt"
set count1 to call len with lines1
print count1
# Expected: 3 or 4 (depending on implementation)

# File with empty lines
call write_file with "empty_lines.txt", "line1\n\nline2\n\nline3"
set lines2 to call read_lines with "empty_lines.txt"
set count2 to call len with lines2
print count2
# Expected: 5

# File with trailing newline
call write_file with "trailing_newline.txt", "hello\n"
set lines3 to call read_lines with "trailing_newline.txt"
set count3 to call len with lines3
print count3
# Expected: 1 or 2 (depending on implementation)

# File with no trailing newline
call write_file with "no_trailing_newline.txt", "hello"
set lines4 to call read_lines with "no_trailing_newline.txt"
set count4 to call len with lines4
print count4
# Expected: 1

# File with single line
call write_file with "single_line.txt", "single"
set lines5 to call read_lines with "single_line.txt"
set count5 to call len with lines5
print count5
# Expected: 1
