# Test: Advanced modulo operations
# Expected: Pass

# Modulo with floating point
set result1 to 10.5 mod 3.2
print result1

# Modulo with negative numbers
set result2 to -10 mod 3
print result2

# Modulo in complex expression
set a to 20
set b to 7
set result3 to a mod b
print result3

# Modulo with precedence
set result4 to 10 mod 3 plus 5
print result4

# Modulo in conditional
set x to 15
if x mod 5 is equal 0:
    print "divisible by 5"
