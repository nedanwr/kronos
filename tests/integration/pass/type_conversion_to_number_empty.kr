# Test to_number with empty string
# Note: Current implementation returns 0.0 for empty string (strtod behavior)
# This might be considered a bug - empty string should probably fail
# Expected: 0 (current behavior) or Error (if bug is fixed)

set num to call to_number with ""
print num
# Expected: 0 (current implementation behavior)
