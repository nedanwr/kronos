# Test: Basic multiple return values
# Expected: Pass

# Function that returns two values
function divide_with_remainder with a, b:
    let quotient to a divided by b
    let quotient to call floor with quotient
    set remainder to a mod b
    return quotient, remainder

# Call the function and unpack results
set q, r to call divide_with_remainder with 10, 3
print q
print r

# Another function returning multiple values
function get_min_max with nums:
    let min_val to nums at 0
    let max_val to nums at 0
    for n in nums:
        if n is less than min_val:
            let min_val to n
        if n is greater than max_val:
            let max_val to n
    return min_val, max_val

set numbers to list 5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 3
set lo, hi to call get_min_max with numbers
print lo
print hi
