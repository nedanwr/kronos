# Test map set operations using map literals

# Create map with multiple entries
set m to map name: "Alice", age: 30
print m
# Expected: {name: Alice, age: 30} (order may vary)

# Access values
print m at "name"
# Expected: Alice

print m at "age"
# Expected: 30

# Create map with number keys
set scores to map 1: 100, 2: 200, 42: "answer"
print scores at 42
# Expected: answer

# Create map with boolean keys
set flags to map true: "yes", false: "no"
print flags at true
