# Empty string matching with wildcard

# Empty string with specific pattern (no match)
set result2 to call regex.match with "", "a"

# Pattern matching empty string
set result3 to call regex.match with "", ".*"

# Search with no match
set result4 to call regex.search with "hello", "xyz"

# Findall with no matches
set result5 to call regex.findall with "hello", "xyz"

# Findall with overlapping potential matches (should find all)

# Anchors - start of string
