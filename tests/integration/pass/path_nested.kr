# Nested path operations
# Expected output:
# Full path: /home/user/documents/file.txt
# Directory: /home/user/documents
# Parent dir: /home/user
# File name: file.txt

# Create a nested path
set path1 to call join_path with "/home/user", "documents"
set full_path to call join_path with path1, "file.txt"
print f"Full path: {full_path}"

# Get directory
set dir to call dirname with full_path
print f"Directory: {dir}"

# Get parent directory
set parent_dir to call dirname with dir
print f"Parent dir: {parent_dir}"

# Get file name
set file_name to call basename with full_path
print f"File name: {file_name}"
