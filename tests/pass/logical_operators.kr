# Test: Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)
# Expected: Pass

# Test AND operator
set x to 7
if x is greater than 5 and x is less than 10:
    print "AND: x is between 5 and 10"

# Test OR operator
set isActive to true
set isAdmin to false
if isActive or isAdmin:
    print "OR: access granted"

# Test NOT operator
set isDisabled to false
if not isDisabled:
    print "NOT: enabled"

# Test complex AND expression
set a to 5
set b to 10
if a is greater than 3 and b is less than 15:
    print "Complex AND: both conditions true"

# Test complex OR expression
set score1 to 85
set score2 to 75
if score1 is greater than 90 or score2 is greater than 80:
    print "Complex OR: at least one condition true"

# Test NOT with comparison
set value to 5
if not (value is equal 10):
    print "NOT with comparison: value is not 10"

# Test nested logical operators
set x2 to 7
set y2 to 12
if x2 is greater than 5 and (y2 is less than 10 or y2 is greater than 15):
    print "Nested: complex condition"
