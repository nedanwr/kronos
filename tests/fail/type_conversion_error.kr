# Test type conversion errors

# to_number with invalid string
set num to call to_number with "abc"
# Expected: Runtime error - cannot convert string to number

# to_number with list
set num2 to call to_number with list 1, 2, 3
# Expected: Runtime error - to_number requires string or number

# to_bool with list
set b to call to_bool with list 1, 2
# Expected: Runtime error - cannot convert type to boolean
