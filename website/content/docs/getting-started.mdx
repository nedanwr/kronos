# Getting Started with Kronos

Welcome to Kronos! This guide will help you get up and running quickly.

## Installation

### Building from Source

Kronos is built in C and requires a C compiler (GCC or Clang) and `make`.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kronos.git
cd kronos

# Build Kronos
make

# The binary will be available as ./kronos
```

### Dependencies

- **C Compiler**: GCC or Clang
- **Make**: Build system
- **gperf**: For keyword hashing (usually available via package manager)

**macOS:**

```bash
brew install gperf
```

**Ubuntu/Debian:**

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential gperf
```

## Running Your First Program

Create a file called `hello.kr`:

```kronos
print "Hello, World!"
```

Run it:

```bash
./kronos hello.kr
```

You should see:

```
Hello, World!
```

## Interactive REPL

Kronos includes an interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) for testing code:

```bash
./kronos
```

You can type expressions directly:

```kronos
> 10 plus 20
30
> set name to "Kronos"
> print name
Kronos
```

The REPL includes:

- **Command history**: Use arrow keys to navigate previous commands
- **Tab completion**: Get suggestions for keywords, functions, and variables
- **Multi-line input**: Automatically handles multi-line code blocks

## Command-Line Options

```bash
# Execute a file
./kronos script.kr

# Execute code directly
./kronos -e "print 42"

# Multiple -e flags
./kronos -e "set x to 10" -e "print x"

# Show version
./kronos --version

# Show help
./kronos --help
```
