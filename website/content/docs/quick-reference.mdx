# Quick Reference

Syntax cheat sheet for Kronos. For detailed explanations, see the [Language Reference](/docs/language/variables).

## Variables

```kronos
set name to "Alice"      # Immutable
let counter to 0         # Mutable
let age to 25 as number  # With type annotation
```

## Data Types

| Type    | Example                   |
| ------- | ------------------------- |
| Number  | `42`, `3.14`, `-10`       |
| String  | `"Hello"`, `f"Hi {name}"` |
| Boolean | `true`, `false`           |
| Null    | `null`                    |
| List    | `list 1, 2, 3`            |
| Map     | `map key: "value"`        |

## Operators

| Operation      | Syntax                       |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Addition       | `a plus b`                   |
| Subtraction    | `a minus b`                  |
| Multiplication | `a times b`                  |
| Division       | `a divided by b`             |
| Modulo         | `a mod b`                    |
| Equal          | `a is equal b`               |
| Not equal      | `a is not equal b`           |
| Greater        | `a is greater than b`        |
| Less           | `a is less than b`           |
| And/Or/Not     | `a and b`, `a or b`, `not a` |

## Control Flow

```kronos
# Conditional
if condition:
    statement

# For loop
for i in range 1 to 10:
    print i

# For-each loop
for item in items:
    print item

# While loop
while condition:
    statement
```

## Functions

```kronos
function greet with name:
    print f"Hello, {name}!"

call greet with "Alice"

# Multiple return values
function divide with a, b:
    return a divided by b, a mod b

set q, r to call divide with 10, 3

# Variable swapping
let x, y to y, x
```

## Strings

```kronos
set char to text at 0           # Indexing
set slice to text from 0 to 5   # Slicing
set msg to f"Hello, {name}!"    # F-strings
set fmt to f"{price:.2f}"       # Format specifiers
```

## Lists

```kronos
set nums to list 1, 2, 3
print nums at 0                 # Access: 1
let nums at 0 to 10             # Modify
```

## Maps

```kronos
set user to map name: "Alice", age: 30
print user at "name"            # Access
delete user at "age"            # Delete key
```

## Imports

```kronos
import math
import utils from "utils.kr"
```

## Exception Handling

```kronos
try:
    raise "Error"
catch error:
    print error
finally:
    print "Done"
```

## File I/O

```kronos
set content to call read_file with "file.txt"
call write_file with "out.txt", "Hello"
```

## Common Functions

```kronos
call len with items             # Length
call uppercase with text        # "HELLO"
call split with text, ","       # Split string
call sort with numbers          # Sort list
call to_number with "42"        # Parse number
```

## Running Programs

```bash
./kronos script.kr    # Run file
./kronos              # Start REPL
./kronos -e "code"    # Execute inline
```
