# Functions

Functions allow you to organize code into reusable blocks.

## Defining Functions

**Syntax:**
```kronos
function <function_name> with <param1>, <param2>, ...:
    <function_body>
    return <value>
```

**Example:**
```kronos
function greet with name:
    set message to f"Hello, {name}!"
    return message
```

## Calling Functions

Use the `call` keyword to invoke functions:

```kronos
set greeting to call greet with "Alice"
print greeting  # Prints: Hello, Alice!
```

## Return Values

Functions can return values using the `return` statement:

```kronos
function add with a, b:
    return a plus b

set result to call add with 5, 3
print result  # Prints: 8
```

If no return statement is provided, the function returns `null`.

## Anonymous Functions (Lambdas)

Anonymous functions (also called lambdas) are functions that can be assigned to variables and passed around as values. They are defined using the `function with` syntax without a function name.

### Single-Line Lambdas

For simple expressions, use the single-line syntax:

```kronos
set double to function with x: return x times 2
set result to call double with 5
print result  # Prints: 10
```

The `return` keyword is optional for single-line lambdas:

```kronos
set triple to function with x: x times 3
print call triple with 4  # Prints: 12
```

### Multi-Line Lambdas

For more complex logic, use the multi-line block syntax:

```kronos
set calculate to function with a, b:
    set sum to a plus b
    print f"Sum: {sum}"
    return sum

set result to call calculate with 3, 4
print result  # Prints: 7
```

### Multiple Parameters

Lambdas can take any number of parameters:

```kronos
set add to function with a, b: a plus b
set multiply to function with x, y: x times y

print call add with 2, 3       # Prints: 5
print call multiply with 4, 5  # Prints: 20
```

### Use Cases

Lambdas are useful when you need a quick, reusable function without defining a named function:

```kronos
# Absolute value function
set abs_value to function with n:
    if n is less than 0:
        return n times -1
    return n

print call abs_value with -5  # Prints: 5
print call abs_value with 5   # Prints: 5
```

## Multiple Parameters

Functions can take multiple parameters:

```kronos
function calculate_total with price, quantity, tax_rate:
    set subtotal to price times quantity
    set tax to subtotal times tax_rate
    return subtotal plus tax

set total to call calculate_total with 10.0, 3, 0.08
print total
```

## Local Scope

Variables defined inside functions are local to that function:

```kronos
set global_var to "global"

function test_scope:
    set local_var to "local"
    print global_var  # Can access global variables
    print local_var   # Can access local variables

call test_scope
print global_var  # OK: global variable
print local_var   # Error: local_var is not defined
```

## Examples

### Fibonacci Function

```kronos
function fibonacci with n:
    if n is less than 2:
        return n
    
    set a to 0
    set b to 1
    
    for i in range 2 to n:
        set temp to b
        let b to a plus b
        let a to temp
    
    return b

print call fibonacci with 10  # Prints: 55
```

### Factorial Function

```kronos
function factorial with n:
    if n is less than or equal 1:
        return 1
    
    let result to 1
    for i in range 2 to n:
        let result to result times i
    
    return result

print call factorial with 5  # Prints: 120
```

### Function with Conditional Logic

```kronos
function get_grade with score:
    if score is greater than 90:
        return "A"
    else if score is greater than 80:
        return "B"
    else if score is greater than 70:
        return "C"
    else:
        return "F"

print call get_grade with 85  # Prints: B
```
