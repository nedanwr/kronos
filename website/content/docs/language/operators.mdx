# Operators

Kronos uses natural language keywords for all operators, making code more readable.

## Arithmetic Operators

```kronos
set a to 10
set b to 3

set sum to a plus b          # Addition: 13
set diff to a minus b        # Subtraction: 7
set prod to a times b        # Multiplication: 30
set quot to a divided by b   # Division: 3.333...
set mod to a mod b           # Modulo: 1
```

### Unary Negation

```kronos
set x to 10
set neg to -x                # -10
```

## Comparison Operators

All comparison operators use natural language:

```kronos
set x to 10
set y to 5

x is equal y                 # false
x is not equal y             # true
x is greater than y          # true
x is less than y             # false
x is greater than or equal y # true
x is less than or equal y    # false
```

**Note:** The `is` keyword is required for comparisons.

## Logical Operators

```kronos
set a to true
set b to false

a and b                      # false
a or b                       # true
not a                        # false
```

## Operator Precedence

Operators follow standard mathematical precedence:

1. Unary operators (`-`, `not`)
2. Multiplication, division, modulo (`times`, `divided by`, `mod`)
3. Addition, subtraction (`plus`, `minus`)
4. Comparison operators (`is equal`, `is greater than`, etc.)
5. Logical operators (`and`, `or`)

Use parentheses to override precedence:

```kronos
set result to (10 plus 5) times 2    # 30
set result2 to 10 plus (5 times 2)   # 20
```

## Examples

```kronos
# Complex expressions
set score to 85
if score is greater than 80 and score is less than 90:
    print "Grade: B"

# Arithmetic with comparisons
set x to 10
set y to 20
if (x plus y) is greater than 25:
    print "Sum is greater than 25"

# Logical combinations
set is_weekend to false
set is_holiday to true
if is_weekend or is_holiday:
    print "No work today!"
```
