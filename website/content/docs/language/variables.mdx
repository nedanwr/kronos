# Variables

Kronos supports two types of variables: **immutable** (using `set`) and **mutable** (using `let`).

## Immutable Variables (`set`)

Immutable variables cannot be reassigned after their initial value is set.

**Syntax:**
```kronos
set <variable_name> to <value>
```

**Examples:**
```kronos
set x to 5
set name to "Alice"
set pi to 3.14159
```

Attempting to reassign will result in an error:
```kronos
set x to 10
set x to 20  # Error: Cannot reassign immutable variable 'x'
```

## Mutable Variables (`let`)

Mutable variables can be reassigned to new values.

**Syntax:**
```kronos
let <variable_name> to <value>
```

**Examples:**
```kronos
let counter to 0
let counter to 1
let counter to 2  # OK: counter is mutable
```

## Type Annotations (Optional)

You can optionally specify a type using the `as` keyword. Once specified, the variable can only hold values of that type.

**Syntax:**
```kronos
set <variable_name> to <value> as <type>
let <variable_name> to <value> as <type>
```

**Available Types:**
- `number` - Integers and floating-point numbers
- `string` - Text values
- `boolean` - `true` or `false`
- `null` - Represents no value
- `list` - Ordered collections of values
- `map` - Key-value collections

**Examples:**
```kronos
let age to 25 as number
let age to 26 as number       # OK: still a number
let age to "twenty"           # Error: Type mismatch

set name to "Bob" as string
let flag to true as boolean
let flag to false as boolean  # OK: still a boolean
```

## Variable Naming Rules

- Variable names must start with a letter or underscore
- Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores
- Case sensitive (`myVar` and `myvar` are different)
- Cannot use reserved keywords

## When to Use `set` vs `let`

- Use `set` for values that shouldn't change (constants, configuration)
- Use `let` for values that need to be updated (counters, accumulators, loop variables)

**Example:**
```kronos
set MAX_RETRIES to 3 as number
let attempt to 0 as number

while attempt is less than MAX_RETRIES:
    print attempt
    let attempt to attempt plus 1
```
