# Maps

Maps are key-value collections that store pairs of keys and values. Keys can be strings, numbers, booleans, or null.

## Creating Maps

```kronos
# Map with string keys
set person to map name: "Alice", age: 30, city: "NYC"

# Map with number keys
set scores to map 1: 100, 2: 200, 3: 300

# Map with boolean keys
set flags to map true: "yes", false: "no"

# Empty map
set empty_map to map

# Mixed value types
set mixed to map key1: "string", key2: 42, key3: true, key4: null
```

## Accessing Values

Use the `at` keyword to access map values:

```kronos
set person to map name: "Alice", age: 30

set name to person at "name"    # "Alice"
set age to person at "age"      # 30
```

### Different Key Types

```kronos
# Number keys
set scores to map 1: 100, 2: 200
set score1 to scores at 1       # 100

# Boolean keys
set flags to map true: "yes"
set yes_value to flags at true  # "yes"
```

## Deleting Keys

Remove keys from maps using the `delete` statement:

```kronos
let person to map name: "Alice", age: 30, city: "NYC"

delete person at "age"      # Remove age key
delete person at "city"     # Remove city key
```

**Note:** Map assignment (updating values) is not yet supported. This feature is planned for a future release.

## Map Operations

Maps support several built-in operations:

- Access values: `map at key`
- Delete keys: `delete map at key`
- Check existence: Accessing a non-existent key results in a runtime error

## Iterating Over Maps

Currently, direct iteration over maps is not supported. You can work with known keys:

```kronos
set person to map name: "Alice", age: 30, city: "NYC"

set keys to list "name", "age", "city"
for key in keys:
    print person at key
```

## Examples

### Configuration Map

```kronos
set config to map "host": "localhost", "port": 8080, "debug": true

set host to config at "host"
set port to config at "port"
set debug to config at "debug"

print f"Connecting to {host}:{port}"
```

### User Profile

```kronos
set user to map name: "Bob", email: "bob@example.com", active: true

print f"User: {user at \"name\"}"
print f"Email: {user at \"email\"}"

if user at "active":
    print "User is active"
```

### Removing Sensitive Data

```kronos
let user_data to map name: "Alice", password: "secret123", email: "alice@example.com"

# Remove password before logging
delete user_data at "password"
print user_data  # Only name and email remain
```
