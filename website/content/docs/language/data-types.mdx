# Data Types

Kronos supports several built-in data types.

## Numbers

Numbers can be integers or floating-point values.

```kronos
set integer to 42
set decimal to 3.14159
set negative to -10
set large to 1000000
```

## Strings

Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in double quotes.

```kronos
set greeting to "Hello, World!"
set empty to ""
set multiline to "Line 1\nLine 2"
```

### F-Strings (String Interpolation)

F-strings allow you to embed expressions inside strings:

```kronos
set name to "Alice"
set greeting to f"Hello, {name}!"
print greeting  # Prints: Hello, Alice!

set x to 10
set y to 20
set result to f"{x} plus {y} equals {x plus y}"
print result  # Prints: 10 plus 20 equals 30
```

You can use any expression inside `{}`:
```kronos
set text to "Hello"
set info to f"'{text}' has {call len with text} characters"
```

## Booleans

Boolean values are `true` and `false`.

```kronos
set is_active to true
set is_complete to false
```

## Null

The `null` value represents the absence of a value.

```kronos
set value to null
```

## Lists

Lists are ordered collections of values. See the [Lists documentation](/docs/language/lists) for details.

```kronos
set numbers to list 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
set mixed to list "hello", 42, true, null
```

## Maps

Maps are key-value collections. See the [Maps documentation](/docs/language/maps) for details.

```kronos
set person to map name: "Alice", age: 30, city: "NYC"
set scores to map 1: 100, 2: 200, 3: 300
```

## Type Checking

You can use type annotations to enforce types:

```kronos
let age to 25 as number
let name to "Bob" as string
let active to true as boolean
```

Attempting to assign a different type will result in an error:

```kronos
let age to 25 as number
let age to "twenty"  # Error: Type mismatch
```
