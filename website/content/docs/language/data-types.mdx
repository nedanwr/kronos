# Data Types

Kronos supports several built-in data types.

## Numbers

Numbers can be integers or floating-point values.

```kronos
set integer to 42
set decimal to 3.14159
set negative to -10
set large to 1000000
```

## Strings

Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in double quotes. See the [Strings documentation](/docs/language/strings) for detailed string operations.

```kronos
set greeting to "Hello, World!"
set empty to ""
set multiline to "Line 1\nLine 2"
set formatted to f"Hello, {name}!"  # F-string interpolation
```

## Booleans

Boolean values are `true` and `false`.

```kronos
set is_active to true
set is_complete to false
```

## Null

The `null` value represents the absence of a value.

```kronos
set value to null
```

## Lists

Lists are ordered collections of values. See the [Lists documentation](/docs/language/lists) for details.

```kronos
set numbers to list 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
set mixed to list "hello", 42, true, null
```

## Maps

Maps are key-value collections. See the [Maps documentation](/docs/language/maps) for details.

```kronos
set person to map name: "Alice", age: 30, city: "NYC"
set scores to map 1: 100, 2: 200, 3: 300
```

## Type Annotations

You can use type annotations to enforce types:

```kronos
let age to 25 as number
let name to "Bob" as string
let active to true as boolean
```

Attempting to assign a different type will result in an error:

```kronos
let age to 25 as number
let age to "twenty"  # Error: Type mismatch
```
