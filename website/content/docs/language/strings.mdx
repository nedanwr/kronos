# Strings

Strings are sequences of characters and support various operations.

## Creating Strings

```kronos
set greeting to "Hello, World!"
set empty to ""
set multiline to "Line 1\nLine 2"
```

## String Concatenation

Use the `plus` operator to concatenate strings:

```kronos
set first to "Hello"
set second to "World"
set message to first plus ", " plus second plus "!"
print message  # Prints: Hello, World!
```

## String Indexing

Access individual characters using indexing:

```kronos
set text to "Kronos"

set first_char to text at 0    # "K"
set last_char to text at -1    # "s"
```

## String Slicing

Extract substrings using the `from` keyword:

```kronos
set text to "Programming"

set slice1 to text from 0 to 4      # "Prog"
set slice2 to text from 3 to 7      # "gram"
set slice3 to text from 5 to end    # "mming"
```

## F-Strings (String Interpolation)

F-strings allow you to embed expressions inside strings:

```kronos
set name to "Alice"
set greeting to f"Hello, {name}!"
print greeting  # Prints: Hello, Alice!

set x to 10
set y to 20
set result to f"{x} plus {y} equals {x plus y}"
print result  # Prints: 10 plus 20 equals 30
```

You can use any expression inside `{}`:

```kronos
set text to "Hello"
set info to f"'{text}' has {call len with text} characters"
```

## String Functions

Kronos provides many built-in string functions. See the [Standard Library documentation](/docs/api/strings) for the complete list.

### Common String Functions

```kronos
set text to "  Hello World  "

# Length
set length to call len with text

# Case conversion
set upper to call uppercase with text
set lower to call lowercase with text

# Trimming
set trimmed to call trim with text

# Splitting
set parts to call split with "apple,banana,cherry", ","

# Joining
set words to list "Hello", "World"
set sentence to call join with words, " "

# Searching
set has_hello to call contains with text, "Hello"
set starts_hello to call starts_with with text, "Hello"
set ends_world to call ends_with with text, "World"

# Replacing
set replaced to call replace with text, "World", "Kronos"
```

## Examples

### String Manipulation

```kronos
set text to "  hello world  "
set trimmed to call trim with text
set upper to call uppercase with trimmed
print upper  # Prints: HELLO WORLD
```

### Parsing Strings

```kronos
set data to "name:Alice,age:30,city:NYC"
set parts to call split with data, ","

for part in parts:
    set key_value to call split with part, ":"
    set key to key_value at 0
    set value to key_value at 1
    print f"{key}: {value}"
```

### Building Strings

```kronos
set items to list "apple", "banana", "cherry"
let result to ""

for i in range 0 to call len with items:
    set item to items at i
    if i is equal 0:
        let result to item
    else:
        let result to result plus ", " plus item

print result  # Prints: apple, banana, cherry
```
