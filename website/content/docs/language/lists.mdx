# Lists

Lists are ordered collections of values. They can contain any type of value, including mixed types.

## Creating Lists

```kronos
set numbers to list 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
set fruits to list "apple", "banana", "cherry"
set mixed to list "hello", 42, true, null
set empty to list
```

## Accessing Elements

### Indexing

Lists use zero-based indexing:

```kronos
set numbers to list 10, 20, 30, 40, 50

set first to numbers at 0    # 10
set second to numbers at 1   # 20
set last to numbers at 4     # 50
```

### Negative Indexing

Use negative indices to access elements from the end:

```kronos
set numbers to list 10, 20, 30, 40, 50

set last to numbers at -1        # 50
set second_last to numbers at -2 # 40
```

## Slicing

Extract a portion of a list using the `from` keyword:

```kronos
set numbers to list 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

set slice1 to numbers from 2 to 5      # [2, 3, 4]
set slice2 to numbers from 0 to 3      # [0, 1, 2]
set slice3 to numbers from 5 to end    # [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

## Modifying Lists

Lists created with `let` can be modified:

```kronos
let numbers to list 1, 2, 3

let numbers at 0 to 10       # [10, 2, 3]
let numbers at 2 to 30       # [10, 2, 30]
let numbers at -1 to 50      # [10, 2, 50]
```

**Note:** Lists created with `set` are immutable and cannot be modified.

## Iterating Over Lists

```kronos
set fruits to list "apple", "banana", "cherry"

for fruit in fruits:
    print fruit
```

## List Functions

See the [Collection Functions API](/docs/api/collection-functions) for `len`, `reverse`, and `sort`.

```kronos
set numbers to list 3, 1, 4, 1, 5
set length to call len with numbers      # 5
set sorted to call sort with numbers     # [1, 1, 3, 4, 5]
set reversed to call reverse with numbers # [5, 1, 4, 1, 3]
```

## Examples

### Finding Maximum Value

```kronos
set numbers to list 3, 7, 2, 9, 1, 5
let max to numbers at 0

for num in numbers:
    if num is greater than max:
        let max to num

print max  # Prints: 9
```

### Nested Lists

```kronos
set matrix to list list 1, 2, 3, list 4, 5, 6, list 7, 8, 9

for row in matrix:
    for cell in row:
        print cell
```
