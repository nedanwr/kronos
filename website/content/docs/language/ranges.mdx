# Ranges

Ranges represent sequences of numbers and are commonly used in loops and for generating number sequences.

## Creating Ranges

```kronos
# Basic range: from start to end (inclusive start, exclusive end)
set r1 to range 1 to 10

# Range with step
set r2 to range 0 to 100 by 5

# Negative step
set r3 to range 10 to 0 by -1
```

## Using Ranges in Loops

Ranges are most commonly used in `for` loops:

```kronos
# Count from 1 to 10
for i in range 1 to 10:
    print i

# Count by 2s
for i in range 0 to 20 by 2:
    print i  # Prints: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18

# Countdown
for i in range 10 to 0 by -1:
    print i
```

## Range Indexing

You can access individual values in a range using indexing:

```kronos
set r to range 10 to 20

set first to r at 0    # 10
set second to r at 1   # 11
set last to r at -1    # 19
```

## Range Slicing

Extract portions of a range:

```kronos
set r to range 0 to 100

set slice1 to r from 10 to 20    # Range from 10 to 20
set slice2 to r from 0 to 50     # Range from 0 to 50
```

## Range Length

Get the number of elements in a range:

```kronos
set r to range 1 to 10
set length to call len with r
print length  # Prints: 9 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
```

## Examples

### Generating Number Sequences

```kronos
# Even numbers
for i in range 0 to 20 by 2:
    print i

# Multiples of 5
for i in range 0 to 100 by 5:
    print i
```

### Iterating with Index

```kronos
set items to list "apple", "banana", "cherry"

for i in range 0 to call len with items:
    set item to items at i
    print f"{i}: {item}"
```

### Range Arithmetic

```kronos
# Sum of numbers from 1 to 100
let sum to 0
for i in range 1 to 101:
    let sum to sum plus i

print sum  # Prints: 5050
```
