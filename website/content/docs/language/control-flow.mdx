# Control Flow

Kronos provides natural language keywords for control flow statements.

## Conditional Statements

### If Statements

```kronos
set age to 18

if age is greater than or equal 18:
    print "You are an adult"
```

### If-Else

```kronos
set temperature to 25

if temperature is greater than 20:
    print "It's warm"
else:
    print "It's cold"
```

### If-Else-If

```kronos
set score to 85

if score is greater than 90:
    print "Grade: A"
else if score is greater than 80:
    print "Grade: B"
else if score is greater than 70:
    print "Grade: C"
else:
    print "Grade: D or F"
```

## Loops

### For Loops

Iterate over a range:

```kronos
for i in range 1 to 10:
    print i
```

Iterate over a list:

```kronos
set fruits to list "apple", "banana", "cherry"

for fruit in fruits:
    print fruit
```

### While Loops

```kronos
let counter to 5

while counter is greater than 0:
    print counter
    let counter to counter minus 1
```

### Break and Continue

Use `break` to exit a loop early:

```kronos
for i in range 1 to 10:
    if i is equal 5:
        break
    print i
# Prints: 1, 2, 3, 4
```

Use `continue` to skip to the next iteration:

```kronos
for i in range 1 to 10:
    if i mod 2 is equal 0:
        continue
    print i
# Prints: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
```

**Note:** `break` and `continue` can only be used inside loops.

## Nested Control Flow

You can nest conditionals and loops:

```kronos
for i in range 1 to 5:
    if i mod 2 is equal 0:
        print f"{i} is even"
    else:
        print f"{i} is odd"
```

## Examples

### Finding Maximum Value

```kronos
set numbers to list 3, 7, 2, 9, 1, 5
let max to numbers at 0

for num in numbers:
    if num is greater than max:
        let max to num

print f"Maximum: {max}"
```

### FizzBuzz

```kronos
for i in range 1 to 20:
    if i mod 15 is equal 0:
        print "FizzBuzz"
    else if i mod 3 is equal 0:
        print "Fizz"
    else if i mod 5 is equal 0:
        print "Buzz"
    else:
        print i
```
