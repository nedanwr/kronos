# Collection Functions

Functions for manipulating lists and maps. These functions are available globally.

## List Functions

### reverse

Return a new list with elements in reverse order.

**Syntax:** `call reverse with list`

**Example:**
```kronos
set original to list 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
set reversed to call reverse with original  # Returns [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

**Note:** Returns a new list; does not modify the original.

### sort

Return a new sorted list.

**Syntax:** `call sort with list`

**Example:**
```kronos
set unsorted to list 3, 1, 4, 1, 5
set sorted to call sort with unsorted  # Returns [1, 1, 3, 4, 5]

set words to list "zebra", "apple", "banana"
set sorted_words to call sort with words  # Returns ["apple", "banana", "zebra"]
```

**Note:** 
- Returns a new list; does not modify the original
- Works with numbers or strings, but all elements must be the same type
- Sorting is done in ascending order

## Length

### len

Get the length of a list or map.

**Syntax:** `call len with collection`

**Example:**
```kronos
set numbers to list 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
set length to call len with numbers  # Returns 5
```

## Examples

### Sorting Numbers

```kronos
set scores to list 85, 92, 78, 96, 88
set sorted_scores to call sort with scores

print "Original:"
print scores
print "Sorted:"
print sorted_scores
```

### Reversing a List

```kronos
set items to list "first", "second", "third"
set reversed_items to call reverse with items

for item in reversed_items:
    print item  # Prints: third, second, first
```

### Finding Maximum Value

```kronos
set numbers to list 3, 7, 2, 9, 1, 5

# Sort and get last element
set sorted_nums to call sort with numbers
set length to call len with sorted_nums
set max_val to sorted_nums at (length minus 1)

print max_val  # Prints: 9
```

### Working with Sorted Data

```kronos
set data to list 42, 15, 8, 23, 4, 16
set sorted_data to call sort with data

print "Sorted data:"
for num in sorted_data:
    print num

# Get median (middle value)
set length to call len with sorted_data
set middle_index to length divided by 2
set median to sorted_data at middle_index
print f"Median: {median}"
```

### Combining List Operations

```kronos
set original to list 5, 2, 8, 1, 9, 3

# Sort first
set sorted to call sort with original

# Then reverse to get descending order
set descending to call reverse with sorted

print "Ascending:"
print sorted
print "Descending:"
print descending
```
